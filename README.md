# Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm from Scratch
Learn Machine Learning from basic to advance and develop Machine Learning Models from Scratch in Python

## 1. WHAT YOU WILL LEARN?
* Obtain a solid understand of machine learning in general from basic to advance
* Complete tutorial about basic packages like NumPy and Pandas
* Data Preprocessing and Data Visualization
* Have an understand of Machine Learning and how to apply it in your own programs
* Understanding the concept behind the algorithms
* Knowing how to optimize hyperparameters of your models
* Learn how to develop models based on the requirement of your future business
* Potential for a new job in the future

## 2. DESCRIPTION
Are you interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, but you donâ€™t have any background, and you find the concepts confusing?
<br>Are you interested in programming in Python, but you always afraid of coding?

<b> ðŸ˜ŠI think this repo is for you!ðŸ˜Š</b>

Even you are familiar with machine learning, this repo can help you to review all the techniques and understand the concept behind each term.
This repo is completely categorized, and I donâ€™t start from the middle! I actually start the concept of every term, and then I try to implement it in Python step by step. The structure of the course is as follows:

## 3. WHO THIS REPO IS FOR:
* Anyone with any background that interested in Data Science and Machine Learning with at least high school (+2) knowledge in mathematics
* Beginners, intermediate, and even advanced students in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science (DS), and Machine Learning (ML)
* Students in college that looking for securing their future jobs
* Students that look forward to excel their Final Year Project by learning Machine Learning
* Anyone who afraid of coding in Python but interested in Machine Learning concepts
* Anyone who wants to create new knowledge on the different dataset using machine learning
* Students who want to apply machine learning models in their projects
