The two most popular approach to data quality inspection is: Data Profiling and Data visualization

## 1.1. Data Profiling

Data profiling is reviewing source data, understanding structure, content, and interrelationships, and identifying potential for data projects

Data profiling is a crucial part of

- Data warehouse and business intelligence (DW/BI) projects—data profiling can uncover data quality issues in data sources, and what needs to be corrected in ETL.
- Data conversion and migration projects—data profiling can identify data quality issues, which you can handle in scripts and data integration tools copying data from source to target. It can also uncover new requirements for the target system.
- Source system data quality projects—data profiling can highlight data that suffers from serious or numerous quality issues, and the source of the issues (e.g. user inputs, errors in interfaces, data corruption).
