# K-Means Clustering From Scratch Python 

In this article, I will cover k-means clustering from scratch. In general, Clustering is defined as the grouping of data points such that the data points in a group will be similar or related to one another and different from the data points in another group. The goal of clustering is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabelled data.

K- means is an unsupervised partitional clustering algorithm that is based on grouping data into k â€“ numbers of clusters by determining centroid using the Euclidean or Manhattan method for distance calculation. It groups the object based on minimum distance.
